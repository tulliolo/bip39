# Bip39
A Bip39 library, with a CLI and collection of tools.

This project provides a full implementation of the [Bip39 specs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), together with a CLI that implements some mnemonic key management tools such as:
- generate and validate mnemonics;
- correct the last word according to the checksum (e.g. when a mnemonic is generated by rolling dices);
- transform (and recreate) mnemonics (e.g. to create plausible deniability side-wallets);
- hide/reveal a mnemonic in an image file, with a steganography algorithm.

For further details, please refer to the [documentation folder](https://github.com/tulliolo/bip39/wiki).

**For security reasons, it is highly recommended to run the CLI on an offline system, without any Internet or LAN connection.**
