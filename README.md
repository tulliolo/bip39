# Bip39
A Bip39 library, with a CLI and collection of tools.

This project provides a full implementation of the [Bip39 specs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), along with a CLI that offers some mnemonic key management tools such as:
- **generate** and **validate** mnemonics;
- **correct** the last word according to the checksum (e.g. when a mnemonic is generated by rolling dices);
- **transform** (and restore) mnemonics, e.g. to create side-wallets hiding the original;
- **hide/reveal** a mnemonic in an image file, with a steganography algorithm.

For further details, please refer to the [documentation folder](https://github.com/tulliolo/bip39/wiki).

**For security reasons, it is highly recommended to run the CLI on an offline system, without any Internet or LAN connection.**
