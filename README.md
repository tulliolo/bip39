# Bip39
A Bip39 library, with a CLI and collection of tools.

This project provides a full implementation of the [Bip39 specs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), along with a CLI that offers some mnemonic key management tools such as:
- **generate** and **validate** mnemonics;
- **correct** the last word according to the checksum (e.g. when a mnemonic is generated by rolling dices);
- **transform** (and restore) mnemonics, e.g. to create side-wallets hiding the original;
- **hide/reveal** a mnemonic in an image file, with a steganography algorithm.

For further details, please refer to the [documentation folder](https://github.com/tulliolo/bip39/wiki).

**For security reasons, it is highly recommended to run the CLI on an offline system, without any Internet or LAN connection.**

## Requirements
python 3.10+

```

## Usage Examples
Here are some examples of using the library and CLI.

### CLI
Generate a new 24 words mnemonic:
```

Validate a mnemonic, correcting the checksum:
```
$ bip39-cli validate -f
******************
* bip39-cli v0.2 *
******************

enter a mnemonic:
â‚¿ view fresh drink impulse doctor wise another smoke license collect unaware immense
invalid checksum | expected: 0 | obtained: c

validation success... with fixed checksum:
